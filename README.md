"# Camera_Noise_Analysis" 

Github created for research purposes.

Charge Coupled Devices (CCD) are uniquitous photon capturing devices. It plays a big role in fields like spectroscopy, localization of objects, medical imaging, etc. The analysis of noise in CCD is therefore of great interest to engineers. We question the default choice of using the smallest hardware binning configuration in usual experiments, and investigate the gain in information by circumventing the huge read out noise by smart sequences of hardware binning. With the success of deep learning microscopy, we also apply the famous residual network in helping us achieve efficient particle localization.
